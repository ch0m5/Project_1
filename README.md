# Andro Dunos Tribute by Crispy Crunch
This is a university project made by CITM (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona, in which we try to recreate the NEO GEO arcade game Andro Dunos using C++.

Andro Dunos is a side scrolling shoot 'em up Japanese arcade game developed by Visco Games and published in the Neo-Geo by SNK Corporation (Shin Nihon Kikaku) in 1992. In Andro Dunos the player controls a spaceship that fires 4 different kind of projectiles which he/she can upgrade by defeating enemy ships and gathering power ups. Each type of shot also offers a different charged attack, which allows the player to deal with big numbers of enemies in very though situations. The main goal of the game is to shoot your way through several levels and defeat each final boss.

You can see the full video gameplay on our [Webpage](https://goo.gl/3yk2Mg) or clicking this [link](https://goo.gl/DHgDgy).
